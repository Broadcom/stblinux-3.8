* Broadcom STB SPI Controller

The Broadcom STB SPI controller supports serial flash through both the MSPI and
BSPI interfaces.

Required properties:
- compatible     : should be "brcm,spi-brcmstb"
- reg            : base address and length of the (1) MSPI, (2) BSPI, and (3)
                   BSPI RAF register regions
- interrupts     : the appropriate HIF SPI interrupt
- #address-cells : should be <1>; subnodes will give their chip-select number as
                   their reg (see spi-bus.txt)
- #size-cells    : should be <0>

Optional properties:
- num-cs         : specifies the number of chip select lines supported (see
                   spi-bus.txt). If not specified, the default number of chip
                   select lines is set to 4.

SPI controller properties in subnodes (slaves):
- use-bspi       : boolean, asserting that this slave should use BSPI
                   acceleration

For other slave properties, see spi-bus.txt. Also note that flash partitioning
(e.g., for m25p80) is specified by mtd/partition.txt.

Example:

spi0@0 {
	compatible = "brcm,spi-brcmstb";
	interrupts = < 0 33 0>;
	reg = <0xf0443400 0x187>,
	      <0xf0443200 0x50>,
	      <0xf0443300 0x23>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	m25p80@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "m25p80";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <40000000>;
		spi-cpol;
		spi-cpha;
		use-bspi;

		flash0@0 {
			reg = <0 0>; // MTDPART_SIZ_FULL
		};
	};
};
