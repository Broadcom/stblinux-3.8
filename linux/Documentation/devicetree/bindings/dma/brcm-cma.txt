* Broadcom STB CMA Platform Device

The Broadcom STB CMA Platform Device is a character device intended for
providing a user-space interface to the dma-contiguous (CMA) API. More
specifically, this implementation allows for allocation of contiguous physical
memory on a particular memory controller (MEMC) within an STB SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible              : compatible list, contains "brcm,cma-plat-dev"
- linux,contiguous-region : A phandle to a memory/region node, as defined
                            in the CMA 'memory.txt' binding.

Example:
	/* snip */

	/* This node is defined per binding in 'memory.txt' */
	memory {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		device_type = "memory";
		reg = <0x0 0x40000000>;
		region_0: region@30000000 {
			contiguous-region;
			reg = <0x30000000 0x10000000>;
		};
	};

	/* snip */

	/*
	 * This node instantiates a CMA device, using the region with name
	 * 'region_0' as its range.
	 */
	cma-dev@0 {
		#address-cells = <0>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "brcm,cma-plat-dev";
		linux,contiguous-region = <&region_0>;
	};
