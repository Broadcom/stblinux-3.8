** Broadcom STB Power Management

Broadcom STB power management involves several hardware components which are
documented here.

* Always-On control block (AON CTRL)

This hardware provides control registers for the "always-on" (even in low-power
modes) hardware, such as the Power Management State Machine (PMSM).

Required properties:
- compatible     : should contain "brcm,brcmstb-aon-ctrl"
- reg            : the register start and length for the AON CTRL block

Example:

aon-ctrl@f0410000 {
	compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-aon-ctrl";
	reg = <0xf0410000 0x400>;
};

* DDR PHY control

Control registers for the DDR PHY(s) present on the SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible     : should contain "brcm,brcmstb-ddr-phy-v225.1"
- reg            : the register start and length pair(s) for the DDR PHY
		   control block(s), with each block being listed in index
                   order (i.e., DDR-0, DDR-1, etc.)

Example:

ddr-phy {
	compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-ddr-phy-v225.1";
	reg = <0xf1106000 0x24c
	       0xf1186000 0x24c
	       0xf1206000 0x24c>;
};
