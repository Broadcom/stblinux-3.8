* Broadcom Register Save/Restore Mechanism

Broadcom leverages the syscon functionality [1] to save and restore register
sets during PM operations.  Examples of such register sets are pinmux registers,
memc registers, etc.  Each register set to be saved/restored is described by a
syscon node which is defined in [1], for example:

	sun_top_ctrl: syscon@f0404000 {
		compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-sun-top-ctrl",
			"syscon";
		reg = <0xf0404000 0x51c>;
	};

There may be several of these syscons nodes defined.  If syscon nodes are used,
the device tree must define an 's3' node as follows:

Required properties:
- syscon-refs: a phandle list that refers to all of the defined syscon nodes.

Example:
	s3 {
		syscon-refs = <&sun_top_ctrl_pin_mux_ctrl>,
			<&sun_top_ctrl_pin_mux_pad_ctrl>,
			<&aon_pin_ctrl_pin_mux_ctrl>,
			<&aon_pin_ctrl_pad_mux_ctrl>,
			<&memc_arb_0_client_info>,
			<&memc_arb_1_client_info>,
			<&memc_arb_2_client_info>;
	};
