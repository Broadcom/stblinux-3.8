* Broadcom SATA3 AHCI Controller

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
Each SATA controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible         : compatible list, contains "brcm,sata3-ahci"
- reg                : <registers mapping>
- interrupts         : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- phy-generation     : 16-bit integer which describes both the SATA PHY design
		       generation, and revision number.
		       (0xXXYY, XX = generation, YY = rev)
- phy-base-addr      : Address of SATA PHY configuration registers.
- top-ctrl-base-addr : Address of the SATA IP core "top" registers.

Optional properties:
- phy-enable-ssc-mask : A 32-bit bitmask, where each bit is associated with
			one SATA port.
			(e.g.: If bit is 1, spread-spectrum clocking will be
			configured for that port.)
- phy-force-spd       : An array of integer pairs which specify the SATA port
			number and SATA speed generation to use as an
			upper-bound during link speed negotiation.

Example:
	sata@f045a000 {
		compatible = "brcm,sata3-ahci";
		reg = <0xf045a000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x1e 0x0>;
		phy-generation = <0x2800>;
		phy-base-addr = <0xf0458100>;
		phy-enable-ssc-mask = <0x00000001>;
		phy-force-spd = <0 3
				 1 1>;
		top-ctrl-base-addr = <0xf0458040>;
	};
