# AM_AUX_DIR_EXPAND

# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.

dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
dnl
dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
dnl    and used.
dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
dnl    Catalog format: none
dnl    Catalog extension: none
dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
dnl maintainers.
